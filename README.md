IN S04E04 Jian Yang shows his Machine Learning based application for food classification with CV. <br>
Then it appears that his program can classify food only as "Hot dog" and "Not hot dog". <br>
But thankfully we live in 21st century, when humanity evolved to... create such dataset. <br>

So this is a repository of seefood project by Venchislav (inspired by Jian Yang)

P.S it's still in my plans, but now I'm only studying deep learning for computer vision 37 hours tutorial:

UPD from 22.12.23 23:40
I found a nice CNN tutorial <img src='https://media.tenor.com/EQflCSqedPkAAAAM/clash-royale-heheheha.gif' width=2%><br>
Got new books for deep learning and algos... The great things are coming
P.S Today I'll try to finish this project
