IN S04E04 Jian Yang shows his Machine Learning based application for food classification with CV. <br>
Then it appears that his program can classify food only as "Hot dog" and "Not hot dog". <br>
But thankfully we live in 21st century, when humanity evolved to... create such dataset. <br>

So this is a repository of seefood project by Venchislav (inspired by Jian Yang)
